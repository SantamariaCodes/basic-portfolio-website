  "introduction": "My journey into programming began in 2020 when I took a Java course from the University of Helsinki, and I soon realized that software was my calling. I gravitated towards <strong>front-end development</strong> as it felt like a more hands-on approach, and I completely fell in love with it. Over time, I've taken courses in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, web design, Swift IOS, React, and TypeScript, even participating and finishing a bootcamp in 2022.<br/><br/>While I value online courses and bootcamps immensely, nothing, in my opinion, compares to <strong>hands-on experience</strong>. Fortunately, in early 2023 I was accepted as an intern at Tuyo Technologies, a software development company, and was later promoted to Jr Front-end Developer. My fascination for the industry runs deep, and my thirst for knowledge is unquenchable.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that technology has the power to <strong>enhance the human experience</strong>, boost productivity and have a meaningful impact on any business. I'm actively seeking projects where I can contribute and continue on this <strong>never-ending and exciting journey</strong>.",
