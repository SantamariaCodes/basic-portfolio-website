  "introduction": "My journey into programming began in 2020 when I took a Java course from the University of Helsinki, and I soon realized that <strong>software was my calling</strong>. I gravitated towards <strong>front-end development</strong> as it felt like a more hands-on approach, and I completely fell in love with it. Over time, I've taken courses in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, web design, Swift IOS, React, and TypeScript, even participating and finishing a bootcamp in 2022.<br/><br/>While I value online courses and bootcamps immensely, nothing, in my opinion, compares to <strong>hands-on experience</strong>. Fortunately, in early 2023 I was accepted as an intern at Tuyo Technologies, a software development company, and was later promoted to Jr Front-end Developer.<br/><br/>As a developer at Tuyo, I had the opportunity to <strong>lead the creation of the company's landing page</strong>, crafted intricate dashboards to <strong>drive business analytics</strong>, and worked on multiple landing pages that resonated with diverse business needs",
